# Precipitation-Project

![PortlandImage](Images/PortlandPrecip.png)

## Goals
Using a csv file containing rainfall data for Portland, ME and surrounding cities, I have created 
a program that can read in the file, calculate the average precipitation and output a 
'txt' file with the appropriate data.
